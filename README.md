# Virtual Reality Project 2
Team: Thomas Sanchez, Megan Taylor, Andrew Im, Cody Otterbine

# Project Assignment
The watershed development and management game is envisioned as a "multiplayer" game modeled after the classic Monopoly and SimCity. Students are provided a fixed amount of coins and a distinct parcel of land (which is assigned randomly) on which they can either build or expand urban areas, grow crops or engage in industrial activities. All these activities release pollutants (biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrients) into streams and creeks. The release of these pollutants will affect the in-stream health which is measured by decreases in dissolved oxygen (DO) and increases in algae. Critical thresholds of DO and algae (chlorophyll-a) will be used to simulate catastrophic events such as fish kills and loss of riparian habitats. A set of compliance points (CP) are set up on the stream segment to monitor water quality in the stream. 

# Virtual Insanity Game

Third Person View over a small island? With a certain manageable number of resources where every turn certain consequences happen that pollute the environment and reduces the resources.  

# Turns
+ Actions performed based on energy (?)
+ Each action uses energy
+ Max energy increases over time
+ At turn end, Score evaluated and consequences 

# Resources: Quota to meet per people, 

## Water (Cody)
+ Pollution caused by other actions

## Food (Thomas)
### Fauna
+ Over hunt, animals go extinct
### Flora
+ Over farm, Tiles get wasted.
+ Change plants? For better food
## Minerals (Andrew)
+ How farmable, if iron/other deposits exist in it to be mined, etc.
## Wood (Megan)
+ Tree tiles disappear when you use them and grow back very slowly if nothing else is done to that tile




# Different Tile Types
## Main City (Only one in game, predetermined location)
## Resource Tiles
### Water
* Clean/usable, slightly polluted (could cause sickness), very polluted (unusable)
### Land
#### Food
* Producing Food, Good, adds to food resource when used
* Not Producing Food, Overfarmed/overhunted, will die if used
### Minerals-Andrew
* Ore not mined, usable 
* Mined, now a blank tile
### Building Tiles
* Blank tiles can converted into any of the:
* Buildings/Houses, increases Population
* Energy Producer, increases Energy per turn
* Any resource tile

## How to Manage Pollution
### Energy Focus
* Clean Wind Energy, use blank land tiles, decrease pollution
* Hydroelectric Dams, use blank water tiles, decrease pollution
* Coal Power plants, use blank land tiles, increase pollution
#### Farming
* Can choose between using pesticides (increase pollution, runoff) 
* scarecrows (decrease pollution)
### Construction/Building
* Over develope land, increases pollution
* Plant trees, parks, decreases pollution
### Overfishing an area (?)
* Year round fishing, increases pollution
* Seasonal fishing, decrease pollution
### City Pollution
* Proper Waste Treatment, decreases pollution
* Dumping/Littering, Increases Pollution
* Small decrease over time if they donâ€™t do any harmful actions?
### Water
* Waste Dumping, Increases Pollution
* Beach Clean up, Decreases Pollution
* Water Treatment plants, decrease pollution
* Fracking, increases pollution
